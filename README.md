## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamental operations of logic gates and their combinations, offering an intuitive interface to learn and experiment with digital logic. It combines interactive elements with real-time data synchronization for an engaging user experience.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture comprising:

- **Frontend**: Built with React for an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Provides real-time data handling and logic processing, ensuring correctness and consistency.
- **API Integration**: Connects the frontend and backend for dynamic updates and user input handling.

### Logic Gates

Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, acting as tiny decision-makers that process binary information. They operate on binary inputs (0 or 1) and produce a binary output based on specific logical rules.  
Some key types of gates used in this project include:

- **AND**
- **OR**
- **NOT**
- **XOR**
- **NAND**
- **NOR**

These gates form the foundation for constructing intricate circuits powering everything from basic devices to advanced computing systems.

## Algorithms Used

- Logical evaluation algorithms for binary input processing.
- Optimization algorithms to simplify circuit designs and reduce redundancy.
- Real-time synchronization for updating circuit state across components.

## Security Mechanisms

- Authentication using firebase
- Implementation of database rules in order to avoid access from unathorized access.
- Validation of user inputs to prevent errors in circuit creation.
- Backend authorization and secure API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

## Development Process and Design Decisions

- **Frontend Design**: Focused on accessibility, scalability and minimalistic design with intuitive drag-and-drop components for building circuits.
- **Backend Logic**: Designed for efficient processing of logical operations and scalability.
- **Testing**: Conducted unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual gates and their combinations.

## Correctness and Efficiency

- **Correctness**: The project implements truth tables and circuit diagrams for verification.
- **Efficiency**: The system uses optimized algorithms for logic processing, ensuring quick response times even for complex circuits.
